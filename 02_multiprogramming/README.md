# Multiprogramming Processing

In multiprogramming processing, interruptions are implemented that allow the execution of different tasks within a batch, in this way 
it is considered that this type of processing meets the requirements to be considered a pioneering operating system model. The addition 
of interruptions and error handling allows for greater efficiency and reduces problems such as process starvation that occurred with 
batch processing.
